When he&rsquo;s not buried in research or fine-tuning dice mechanics, he&rsquo;s either contemplating his next big design or wondering if he really needs another book on the Eastern Front (he does). With a passion for making quick-playing solo wargames that are both historically rich and mechanically engaging, Martin has created a small independent wargaming company called &quot;Solo Wargame&quot; with a single mission to ensure that no gamer ever has to suffer through an unbalanced AI opponent again."

They are often light-medium weight, making them perfect as gateway games and also offer strategic depth for expert players. With global shipping being expensive and slow, we offer a cheap solution which also decreases the waiting time to receive your games. And ofcourse it's good for the environment to print at your own house instead shipping products all over the world. We hope our games bring joy and excitement to all tables."

By shifting the &quot;game factory&quot; into the homes of our players, we promote sustainability and convenience without compromising on quality. Furthermore, as a company based in a developing economy, we are acutely aware of the financial barriers posed by international shipping and import costs&mdash;often increasing retail prices by a factor of three.

      "bio": "Little Rocket Games is an independent Italian publishing company that deals with the conception, development, production and distribution of board games, card games and librigame. We start from the ideation of the game (we change our mind at least a dozen times), we illustrate every part of it paying maximum attention to the artistic aspect of the product, until, after long days of testing, we create a definitive prototype. We follow the production in all its aspects, we choose the best game components on the Italian and European territory and we assemble the games directly in our warehouse. Finally, we take care of the distribution part of our products, bringing them directly to store shelves. We are able to create your ideas, so don't hesitate to contact us."
