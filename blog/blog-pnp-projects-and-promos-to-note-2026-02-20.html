              <h1>PnP Projects and Promos To Note This Week.</h1>

              <p>If your backlog is already full, this is still a week to pay attention. The strongest move right now is backing the campaigns and promos that are almost out of runway, then circling back for the longer-window projects.</p>

              <h2>Final-Day Priority: Ending Soonest</h2>

              <p><strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/105281170/fliegerkorps">Fliegerkorps</a> (Kickstarter)</strong><br />
              Designer/Publisher: Martin Melbardis<br />
              Ends in: <strong><span class="days-left" data-end-date="2026-02-20">1 day left</span></strong><br />
              PnP cost: <strong>about $11</strong><br />
              Why consider backing: this one is a focused solo wargame lane from a creator who clearly designs for historical tension and AI balance, not just theme dressing. If you want compact solo decision-making with a military operations feel, this is a sharp fit.</p>

              <p><strong><a href="https://itch.io/s/180328/-birthday-sale-">Birthday Sale (Grim World / The Promise)</a> (Itch promo)</strong><br />
              Designer/Publisher: Raoul Schaupp<br />
              Ends in: <strong><span class="days-left" data-end-date="2026-02-20">1 day left</span></strong><br />
              PnP cost: <strong>33% off for both games until tomorrow</strong><br />
              Why consider backing: this is not a normal campaign; it is a tight promo window. If you have been waiting to pick up Grim World or The Promise, this is your discount shot before the price snaps back.</p>

              <p><strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weirdgiraffegames/logic-and-lore-2nd-edition/description">Logic &amp; Lore 2nd Edition &amp; Expansion</a> (Kickstarter)</strong><br />
              Designer: Jason Hager | Publisher: Weird Giraffe Games<br />
              Ends in: <strong><span class="days-left" data-end-date="2026-02-24">5 days left</span></strong><br />
              PnP cost: <strong>$10</strong><br />
              Why consider backing: this is a revised edition plus expansion content at a low entry point. If you value smart cardplay with new tactical depth and want a clean value-per-dollar pick this week, this is one of the easiest yes calls.</p>

              <p><strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/timetodice/red-dungeon">Red Dungeon</a> (Kickstarter)</strong><br />
              Designer: Krzysiek Pietrzak | Publisher: Time to Dice<br />
              Ends in: <strong><span class="days-left" data-end-date="2026-02-28">9 days left</span></strong><br />
              PnP cost: <strong>about $6</strong><br />
              Why consider backing: a dungeon crawl angle that leans on a standard 52-card deck keeps setup practical while still giving you that push-forward adventure rhythm.</p>

              <p><strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keepersoffun/orman-a-roll-and-plant-print-and-play-game">ORMAN: A Roll &amp; Plant Print and Play Game</a> (Kickstarter)</strong><br />
              Designer/Publisher: Keepers of Fun<br />
              Ends in: <strong><span class="days-left" data-end-date="2026-02-28">9 days left</span></strong><br />
              PnP cost: <strong>about $6</strong><br />
              Why consider backing: ORMAN stands out because the roll-and-write feel is paired with a planting/growth identity, so it reads less like another abstract numbers sheet and more like an evolving board-state puzzle.</p>

              <h2>Still Live: Strong Roundup With More Time</h2>

              <p><strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/malachi-rempen/almighty/description">Almighty ⚡ The Godliest God Game</a></strong> by Malachi Rempen has <strong><span class="days-left" data-end-date="2026-03-05">14 days left</span></strong>. PnP cost is <strong>$5</strong>, which is one of the best low-risk entries currently live.</p>

              <p><strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/littlerocketgames/one-card-dungeon-hells-door">One Card Dungeon - Hell's Door</a></strong> from Little Rocket Games has <strong><span class="days-left" data-end-date="2026-03-06">15 days left</span></strong>. PnP cost is <strong>about $4</strong>. If you like compact dungeon systems with expansion depth, this is still in a comfortable decision window.</p>

              <p><strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nukazombee/beastward-monster-hunt-rpg-boardgame?ref=1q7wvl">Beastward: Monster Hunt RPG Boardgame</a></strong> from Nuka Zombee Games has <strong><span class="days-left" data-end-date="2026-03-10">18 days left</span></strong>. PnP cost is <strong>about $6</strong>. This one differentiates itself by leaning harder into hunt progression and RPG flavor than typical one-loop combat PnP titles.</p>

              <p><strong><a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/florianfiedler/essence-the-grim-expeditions">Essence: The Grim Expeditions</a></strong> by Florian Fiedler has <strong><span class="days-left" data-end-date="2026-03-03">25 days left</span></strong>. PnP cost is <strong>about $9</strong>. If campaign continuity and tactical character growth are your thing, this is still one of the highest-upside systems on the board.</p>

              <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> if you are only backing one or two projects this week, prioritize the expiring window first (Fliegerkorps and the Grim World promo), then Logic &amp; Lore at $10 before moving into the longer-window picks.</p>
